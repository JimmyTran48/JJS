# Webpack Boilerplate

## About
Webpack boilerplate configured for react. Server proxy initialized for localhost:3000. Currently using the /api endpoint.

## Installation
Run `npm install` to install initial dependencies. The boilerplate is setup to build a React application. Frameworks and other libraries must be installed manually!

## Starting the Dev Server
Running `npm start` will start the server on localhost:3000 and the front-end on localhost:8080. If you just want to work on the front-end, run `npm run start-client`. If you just want to start the server, run `npm run start-server`.
