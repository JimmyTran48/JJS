# Webpack Boilerplate

## About
Webpack boilerplate configured for react. Server proxy initialized for localhost:3000. You should add your own endpoints! 

Make sure to have concurrently and nodemon installed globally!

```
npm i concurrently nodemon -g
```

## Installation
I included react, redux, and express in the package.json file. Run `npm install` to install these frameworks. A database framework is not included.
